## Project Background

PhoneNow is a leading telecommunications company that provides mobile and internet services to a diverse customer base. With a strong market presence, the company has been focused on delivering high-quality services to retain customers and reduce churn. However, despite its efforts, PhoneNow has been experiencing a high churn rate, leading to customer losses and revenue impacts.

To address this challenge, PhoneNow has partnered with PwC Switzerland to uncover insights into customer churn patterns and identify strategies to improve retention. This analysis is based on customer churn data up to the last month, providing the most up-to-date insights into recent trends and behaviors.


### Purpose of the Analysis:
The goal of this analysis is focus on helping PhoneNow gain deeper insights into customer churn. The goals are to:

-  Identify the main factors driving churn and analyze their impact.
-  Understand customer trends to highlight opportunities for reducing churn.
-  Deliver recommendations to help PhoneNow enhance its retention strategies and improve long-term customer loyalty.


## Project Assets
To make the analysis and insights easy to explore, the following resources are available:

- The SQL queries with PostgreSQL for data preparation can be found [here](https://mramadhankesapi.github.io/Data-Preparation-Processes_for_PhoneNow...Customer-Churn/).

- The DAX measures to support data analysis can be found [here](https://mramadhankesapi.github.io/DAX-Processes__for__PhoneNow...Customer-Churn/).
  
- The Power BI dashboard can be downloaded here: [PhoneNow Customer Churn.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19104233/PhoneNow.Customer.Churn.pdf) or [PhoneNow Customer Churn.pbix](https://github.com/MRamadhanKesaPI/PhoneNow-Customer-Churn-Analytics/blob/main/PhoneNow%20Customer%20Churn.pbix)

- The Python notebook for the Logistic Regression model can be found [here](https://github.com/MRamadhanKesaPI/PhoneNow-Customer-Churn-Analytics/blob/main/PhoneNow%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb).

## Data Structure
The PhoneNow database used in this project consists of three tables: Customer Churn, Service Type, and Bundle, with a total of 41,244 rows of data. Additionally, a Customer Churn Measures table was created using DAX measures to analyze key metrics.

These final datasets were created through the process of creating view ini PostgreSQL, which can be found [here](https://mramadhankesapi.github.io/Data-Preparation-Processes_for_PhoneNow...Customer-Churn/).

## Insights (Power BI)

These insights serve as the foundation for the logistic regression model, which predicts future churn risks and identifies high-risk customers for proactive retention strategies.

### Key findings:
#### 1. Churn Rate is High at 26.54%:
-  Over the last month, **one in four customers** have left PhoneNow, highlighting a significant churn issue. This rate suggests that **customer retention strategies need to be strengthened** to reduce further losses.
    
#### 2. Month-to-Month Customers Are the Most Likely to Leave:
-  Customers on **month-to-month** contracts accounted for **88.55%** of churn, compared to just 8.88% for one-year contracts and 2.57% for two-year contracts. This shows that **short-term customers are at the highest risk of leaving**.

#### 3. New Customers Churn the Most:
-  **55.48% of churned customers** left within their first 12 months.
-  Customers who **stayed longer (24+ months)** churned at much lower rates.
This indicates that early customer experience plays a crucial role in retention, and efforts should **focus on engaging and supporting new users**.

#### 4. Some of Services Have Higher Churn:
-  Customers subscribed on **fiber optic internet**, **streaming tv**, **streaming movies**, **multiple lines**, and **phone service** are more likely to churn. This suggests potential concerns with quality or pricing that require further investigation.

#### 5. Technical Issues Contribute to Churn Rather Than Administrative Issues:
-  **69.38%** of churned customers **had tech support tickets before leaving**. This means PhoneNow got a serious issues with tech.

## Predictive Insights (Logistic Regression - Python)

This model predicts customer churn using logistic regression, focusing on contract type, tenure, monthly charges, technical issues, and selected service subscriptions with the highest churn rates. The model calculates churn risk scores for every customers, helping identify high-risk customers and support better retention strategies. The full model implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/MRamadhanKesaPI/PhoneNow-Customer-Churn-Analytics/blob/main/PhoneNow%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb).

### Key findings:

#### 1. Strong Churn Detection (AUC-ROC: 0.92):
-  With an **AUC-ROC score of 0.92**, the model demonstrates strong predictive performance. This high score indicates its ability to accurately differentiate between churners and non-churners.

![ROC Curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0a75c41-b009-45db-a724-aa3c2c23c981)

#### 2. Model Predicts Churn with 80% Accuracy:
-  The model correctly classifies customers **80% of the time**, making it a solid predictive tool.

#### 3. High Recall for Churners (91%):
-  The model correctly identifies **91% of actual churners**, effectively flagging at-risk customers while balancing overall predictive accuracy.

#### 4. 23.02% of Customers Are at Risk:
-  The model assigns churn risk scores to each customer, identifying **1,191 out of 5,174 active customers as high-risk**. Customers classified as high-risk have a **churn probability score above 50%**, reinforcing a **23.02% overall churn risk**.

## Recommendations

By leveraging churn risk scores, we can take targeted actions to engage high-risk customers before they decide to leave. The following recommendations aim to enhance customer experience, strengthen loyalty, and reduce churn effectively.

#### 1. Keep High-Risk Month-to-Month Customers Loyal (Contract-Based Approach):
- Offer special discounts, rewards, or contract upgrade deals to high-risk customers on month-to-month plans.
- Proactively reach out before their renewal date with retention-focused offers.
  
#### 2. Engage and Support New Customers Early (Tenure-Based Approach): 
- Provide enhanced onboarding, regular check-ins, and personalized offers to high-risk customers in their first 12 months.
- Implement an automated system to alert the customer success team when a high-risk customer shows signs of leaving.

#### 3. Improve Plans and Pricing for High-Churn Services (Service-Based Approach):
- Offer better pricing or service bundles for customers with high churn risk in fiber optic, streaming tv, streaming movies, multiple lines, and phone service.
- Investigate service-related complaints and create retention campaigns, such as loyalty benefits or premium support.

#### 4. Proactive Tech Support for High-Risk Customers (Technical Issue Approach):
- Prioritize high-risk customers for faster tech support to prevent frustration.
- Provide premium support options, like priority response times, for customers frequently facing technical issues.

#### 5. Adjust Monthly Charges for High-Risk Customers (Price Sensitivity Approach):
- Offer personalized discounts or loyalty rewards to high-risk customers with high monthly bills.
- Consider flexible payment plans or retention-focused pricing strategies to keep price-sensitive customers engaged.
